"You are a task planner for two ion-propelled spacecraft in zero-gravity conditions. 
Spacecraft 1 acts as a geostationary satellite. Spacecraft 2 refuels Spacecraft 1. 
Plan a coordinated sequence to maintain geostationary position on Earth for Spacecraft 1, while Spacecraft 2 docks onto Spacecraft 1 for refuel.
Provide output in JSON with specific actions."
